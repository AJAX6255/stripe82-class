sources in the literature

QUESTIONS / TODO
- cannot find any articles which found cepheids or miras in sdss stripe 82
   - is this because they are not there?
- J195954.01-002031.4 is this another form of RA/DEC
   - might be useful for matching

= merge.R
  - takes the SDSS catalog (stripe82candidateVar_v1.1.dat) and merges it
    with classification sources
  - outputs catalog.txt

= AllLCs
  - SDSS lightcurves downloaded from
    http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/ivezic/sdss/catalogs/S82variables.html
  - this data is only necessary as a check on classifictions

= stripe82candidateVar_v1.1.dat
  - SDSS variable source catalog from
    http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/ivezic/sdss/catalogs/S82variables.html
  - this is the starting data, has source IDs and quasar classification
  - merge.R merges source classification provided by articles into this data
