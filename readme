====== MAKING CHANGES TO THE REPO ======
You are encouraged to develop the code base of this project and
push changes to the repo. Collaborators on the project will not be
able to use any code which relies on local changes
(changes you have not pushed to the repo). To ensure that the
code running on your machine will run identically for
collaborators it is strongly recommended that after making and pushing
changes you DELETE your local copy of the repo, clone the repo from
github, and then rerun everything. The results are what any collaborator
will see (up to differences in python version).

====== CURRENT DATA SOURCES ======

= SDSS STRIPE 82 VARIABLE SOURCE CATALOG (stripe82candidateVar_v1.1.dat)
  - http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/ivezic/sdss/catalogs/S82variables.html
  - this is the starting data, has source IDs and quasar classification
  - merge.R merges source classification provided by articles into this data

= SDSS VARIABLE SOURCE LIGHT CURVES
  - http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/ivezic/sdss/catalogs/S82variables.html
  - this data is only necessary as a check on classifications
