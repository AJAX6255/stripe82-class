====== TODO / QUESTIONS ======
- cannot find any articles on cepheids or miras in sdss stripe 82
   - is this because miras/cepheids are not in stripe 82
- is J195954.01-002031.4 this another form of RA/DEC?
   - might be useful for matching


====== CURRENT DATA SOURCES ======

= SDSS STRIPE 82 VARIABLE SOURCE CATALOG (stripe82candidateVar_v1.1.dat)

  - merge.R merges source classification provided by articles into this data

= SDSS VARIABLE SOURCE LIGHT CURVES
